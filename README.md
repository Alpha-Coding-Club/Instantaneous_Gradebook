# Instantaneous Gradebook

Objective: Simulate changes in the gradebook to see how that will affect the overall grade

## Example: 
* What score do I need to get on my finals so I get x%?
* If I redo this assignment, what will my grade be now?
* What assignment should I do that will raise my grade up the most?
* etc...

More ideas to come. We're just brainstorming at the moment.
