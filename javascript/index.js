Final Grade Calculator:
We need to take the Mastery Percentage and multiply it by 100
Take that answer and multiply that by Mastery Weight%

Example: 85% of Mastery -> 85 -> multiply by 90% weight and that should get 76.5% of final grade

Repeat for College Readiness

Then add both up and you'll get final grade.

Do Desired grade - final grade???

Take with grain of salt:
Required = (Goal − Current × (100% − Final Weight)) / Final Weight

Grade = Mastery(90%) + CR(10%)

D = M*mw + C*cw

******   M = D/mw - C*cr/mw    Something's missing here  *******


98.3 percent on huan's final
98.3*0.9 = 88.47 + 11.5 = 99.97

We need a way to bump up the 85.13 score on mastery to a 98.3 score on Mastery

63/74 -> 98.3



35/26 on the test means you need a 134.6% to raise your grade to 100%

RIP our brains

85.13*90% = 76.617
115*10% = 11.5
76.617+11.5 = 88.117 -> Pretty Close to Huan's grade
